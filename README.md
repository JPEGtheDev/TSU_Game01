NOTES:

This project will be released to and picked apart by several Tarleton State University Computer Science students 
and is to be used as a point of reference. If this project would so happen to fall out of the hands of TSU Students 
(as it most likely will) I encourage anyone who is reading this document to learn from the material we have provided 
and to pass it forward in a way. If we screwed something up: change it, update it, and share your revisions, 
that is the only thing that we ask of you.

Good luck,
